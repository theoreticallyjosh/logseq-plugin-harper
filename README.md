# `logseq-plugin-harper`

The [Harper](https://writewithharper.com/) [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) plugin is a powerful, privacy-first grammar and spell-checking tool designed specifically for Obsidian users. Unlike many other grammar checkers, Harper operates entirely offline, ensuring your data remains secure while providing real-time, high-performance corrections. This plugin is ideal for writers, academics, and developers who value privacy and efficiency in their workflows.

Unlike other offerings (like Grammarly) Harper explicitly ignores the contents of code fences and inline code blocks.
